## Playbook for create sudo user with ansible on all hosts:

  * Add pass from ansible-vaul to file:
```bash
echo 'XXXMyPassXXX' > .ansible_vault_pass 
echo '.ansible_vault_pass' >> ../../.gitignore
```
```
  - Add var in local ansible.cfg:
    vault_password_file = ./.ansible_vault_pass
```
  * Encrypt user files with ansible-vault:
```bash
ansible-vault encrypt ./users_home/updater_1/.ssh/*
```
