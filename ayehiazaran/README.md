# First homework   

Our first homework assignment, was to work with local Git repo.

##  Main tasks

Initialize local repository


```bash
Branches should be:
1) master (init) + 2 commits
2) dev (from master) 2 commits from master + 2 additional 
3) features/do_one (from dev) + 2 commits from master + 2 additional form dev + 1 additional
4) hotfix/we_gonna_die (from master) 2 commits from master + 1 additional
5) Create README.md with project description 

Pay the following situation:
Release phase - all commits should be inside master (except hotfix)
Hotfix deploy - commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch should be in master first, then in another branches too
```
