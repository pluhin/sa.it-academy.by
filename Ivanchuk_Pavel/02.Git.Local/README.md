##02.GIT.Local 
### My first experience using the GIT version control system.
I use a virtual machine deployed in the Proxmox hypervisor on a production server.
I use Linux Debian version 11.7 as the operating system.
At the moment I installed git, installed zhsk instead of bash (But I have not yet figured out how it
works and how to configure it :)). I created a new directory in which I initialized the GIT repository.
I signed whose GIT it is, but not yet globally. I created a new file (I’m writing in it now), in which
I wrote the first line. Staged and committed this file. I created a new thread and am writing this text.

I decided to also enter the date. Well, I made a second branch, committed the file with the changes 
to it and merged it with the master branch. I checked everything and added the tag as a new version, 
but then I realized that I added it to the master branch, and not to a separate commit. 
I removed the tag, moved to the commit I needed and already added the tag to it.

I made changes to the report file, then removed them from the working directory. Moved to another branch 
to create a new commit.

I didn’t know what format the report should look like, so I wrote it like this. Next time I will write
 more technically and in detail.
