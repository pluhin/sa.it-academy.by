# Additional task

## LXC config file code
```
lxc.net.0.type = veth
lxc.net.0.link = lxcbr0
lxc.net.0.flags = up
lxc.net.0.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:xx:xx:xx

```

## How to run LXC with config
### Debian9

```bash
# First install LXC in not installed
sudo apt-get install lxc lxc-templates

# Create lxc.conf in any place. Create new container with configuration from lxc.conf. .
sudo lxc-create -t debian -f lxc.conf -n db9 -- -r stretch -a amd64

# open your container terminal
sudo lxc-attach -n db9

# run in container
     user_name=insider  
     useradd -d /home/updater $user_name -s /bin/bash
     echo $user_name:vagrant | chpasswd
     mkdir /home/$user_name
     chown $user_name:$user_name /home/$user_name
     echo "$user_name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```

### Centos8
```bash
# First install LXC in not installed
sudo apt-get install lxc lxc-templates

# Create lxc.conf in any place. Create new container with configuration from lxc.conf. .
sudo lxc-create -t download -f lxc.conf -n ct8 -- -d centos -r 8 -a amd64

# open your container terminal
sudo lxc-attach -n ct8

# run in container
     user_name=updater  
     useradd -d /home/updater $user_name -s /bin/bash
     echo $user_name:vagrant | sudo chpasswd
     echo "$user_name ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers
```
