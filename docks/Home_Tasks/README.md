# Home work

## How to send Home work

1. Create fork from the main repository https://github.com/pluhin/sa.it-academy.by
2. Clone forked repository to your workstation
3. Checkout to branch <YOR_GROUP_BRANCH>
4. Create folder with your Name_LastName (As example: In my case name will be `Siarhei_Pishchyk`). This folder will be your report folder.
5. Create folder with name of your homework (Example: `02.Git.Local`)
6. Put your files into it
7. Do not forget about rebase your fork/branch with main fork/branch (how-to demo [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository) and [here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/syncing-a-fork))
8. Make commit and push
9. On WebUI (github) make PR (Pull Request) into main fork and branch <YOR_GROUP_BRANCH> from your fork and your <YOR_GROUP_BRANCH>
10. Wait for review

## 02. GIT. Local

Initialize local repository on your laptop. Create the following branches:

- hotfix/we_gonna_die (from master)
  - 2 commits from master + 1 additional

Play the following situations:

- Release phase - all commits should be inside master (except hotfix)
- Hotfix deploy - commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch should be in master first, then in another branches too

In the end of this "play" you should provide list of your commits in above mentioned branches. You can add this output to your report, in the tail.

All your commands put into files 02.GIT.Local.md and add to your repository, then prepare PR (Pull Request)
> Use git markup to organize your text/output. See [link](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
