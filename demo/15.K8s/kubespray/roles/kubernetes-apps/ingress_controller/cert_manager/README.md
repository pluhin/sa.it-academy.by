Cert-Manager is a native Kubernetes certificate management controller. It can help with issuing certificates from a variety of sources, such as Letâ€™s Encrypt, HashiCorp Vault, Venafi, a simple signing key pair, or self signed. It will ensure certificates are valid and up to date, and attempt to renew certificates at a configured time before expiry.

The Kubespray out-of-the-box cert-manager deployment uses a TLS Root CA certificate and key stored as the Kubernetes `ca-key-pair` secret consisting of `tls.crt` and `tls.key`, which are the base64 encode values of the TLS Root CA certificate and key respectively.

Integration with other PKI/Certificate management solutions, such as HashiCorp Vault will require some further development changes to the current cert-manager deployment and may be introduced in the future.

## Kubernetes TLS Root CA Certificate/Key Secret

If you're planning to secure your ingress resources using TLS client certificates, you'll need to create and deploy the Kubernetes `ca-key-pair` secret consisting of the Root CA certificate and key to your K8s cluster.

If these are already available, simply update `templates\secret-cert-manager.yml.j2` with the base64 encoded values of your TLS Root CA certificate and key prior to enabling and deploying cert-manager.

e.g.

```shell
$ cat ca.pem | base64 -w 0
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBDRVJU...

$ cat ca-key.pem | base64 -w 0
LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBSU0Eg...
```

For further information, read the official [Cert-Manager CA Configuration](https://cert-manager.io/docs/configuration/ca/) doc.

Once the base64 encoded values have been added to `templates\secret-cert-manager.yml.j2`, cert-manager can now be enabled by editing your K8s cluster addons inventory e.g. `inventory\sample\group_vars\k8s-cluster\addons.yml` and setting `cert_manager_enabled` to true.

```ini
# Cert manager deployment
cert_manager_enabled: true
```

If you don't have a TLS Root CA certificate and key available, you can create these by following the steps outlined in section [Create New TLS Root CA Certificate and Key](#create-new-tls-root-ca-certificate-and-key) using the Cloudflare PKI/TLS `cfssl` toolkit. TLS Root CA certificates and keys can also be created using `ssh-keygen` and OpenSSL, if `cfssl` is not available.

## Securing Ingress Resources

A common use-case for cert-manager is requesting TLS signed certificates to secure your ingress resources. This can be done by simply adding annotations to your Ingress resources and cert-manager will facilitate creating the Certificate resource for you. A small sub-component of cert-manager, ingress-shim, is responsible for this.

To enable the Nginx Ingress controller as part of your Kubespray deployment, simply edit your K8s cluster addons inventory e.g. `inventory\sample\group_vars\k8s-cluster\addons.yml` and set `ingress_nginx_enabled` to true.

```ini
# Nginx ingress controller deployment
ingress_nginx_enabled: true
```

For example, if you're using the Nginx ingress controller, you can secure the Prometheus ingress by adding the annotation `cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: ca-issuer` and the `spec.tls` section to the `Ingress` resource definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: prometheus-k8s
  namespace: monitoring
  labels:
    prometheus: k8s
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "nginx"
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: ca-issuer
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - prometheus.example.com
    secretName: prometheus-dashboard-certs
  rules:
  - host: prometheus.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          serviceName: prometheus-k8s
          servicePort: web
```

Once deployed to your K8s cluster, every 3 months cert-manager will automatically rotate the Prometheus `prometheus.example.com` TLS client certificate and key, and store these as the Kubernetes `prometheus-dashboard-certs` secret.

For further information, read the official [Cert-Manager Ingress](https://cert-manager.io/docs/usage/ingress/) doc.

### Create New TLS Root CA Certificate and Key

#### Install Cloudflare PKI/TLS `cfssl` Toolkit.

e.g. For Ubuntu/Debian distibutions, the toolkit is part of the `golang-cfssl` package.

```shell
$ sudo apt-get install -y golang-cfssl
```

#### Create Root Certificate Authority (CA) Configuration File

The default TLS certificate expiry time period is `8760h` which is 5 years from the date the certificate is created.

```shell
$ cat > ca-config.json <<EOF
{
  "signing": {
    "default": {
      "expiry": "8760h"
    },
    "profiles": {
      "kubernetes": {
        "usages": ["signing", "key encipherment", "server auth", "client auth"],
        "expiry": "8760h"
      }
    }
  }
}
EOF
```

#### Create Certficate Signing Request (CSR) Configuration File

The TLS certificate `names` details can be updated to your own specific requirements.

```shell
$ cat > ca-csr.json <<EOF
{
  "CN": "Kubernetes",
  "key": {
    "algo": "rsa",
    "size": 2048
  },
  "names": [
    {
      "C": "US",
      "L": "Portland",
      "O": "Kubernetes",
      "OU": "CA",
      "ST": "Oregon"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

#### Create TLS Root CA Certificate and Key

```shell
$ cfssl gencert -initca ca-csr.json | cfssljson -bare ca
ca.pem
ca-key.pem
```

Check the TLS Root CA certificate has the correct `Not Before` and `Not After` dates, and ensure it is indeed a valid Certificate Authority with the X509v3 extension `CA:TRUE`.

```shell
$ openssl x509 -text -noout -in ca.pem

Certificate:

        Version: 3 (0x2)
