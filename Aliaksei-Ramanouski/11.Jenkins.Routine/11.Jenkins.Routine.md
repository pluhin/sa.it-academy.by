[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Distribution Ubuntu 18.04 on host 192.168.203.46 should 
use /usr/bin/python3, but is using /usr/bin/python for backward compatibility 
with prior Ansible releases. A future Ansible release will default to using the
 discovered platform python for this host. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible
/2.9/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information. This
 feature will be removed in version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled 
by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
