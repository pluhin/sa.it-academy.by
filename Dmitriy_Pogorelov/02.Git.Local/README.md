Merge, rebase

---

## TODO
Initialize local repository. Create the following branches:

1. __master__ (init) 
+ 2 commits

2. *dev* (from __master__) 
+ 2 commits from __master__ + 2 additional 
3. features/do_one (from *dev*)
+ 2 commits from __master__ + 2 additional  form *dev* + 1 additional
4. hotfix/we_gonna_die (from __master__)
+ 2 commits from __master__ + 1 additional
***
Pay the following situations:
- Release phase - all commits should be inside __master__ (except hotfix)
- Hotfix deploy - commit from hotfix/we_gonna_die branch should be in __master__ first, then in another branches too
