+ How to create simple playbook
+ Tasks
---

## TODO
1. Create playbook to print out remote host parameters:
- OS/version
- Mount point/capacity/used
- RAM/capacity/free
2. Playbook for the ansible user
- Create new user (use module)
- New user authorisation only by key
- Add to the sudo:nopasswd for upgrade command
- Implement test of that
> All your playbooks put into folder 05.Ansible run and create file 05.Ansible run.md with description of your ansible code (What it does, examples of command/parametrs) and add to your repository, then prepare PR (Pull Request)
