[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Distribution Ubuntu 16.04 on host workshop should use 
/usr/bin/python3, but is using /usr/bin/python for backward compatibility with 
prior Ansible releases. A future Ansible release will default to using the 
discovered platform python for this host. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/
2.8/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information. This 
feature will be removed in version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled 
by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
