## 11.Jenkins.Routine
In this task I had requirements to create the following pipeline:

- Parameters: host IP and credentials - I used host paremeter for ansible
- Check connection to the host
- Install/upgrade nmap
- Checks all online hosts
- Remove nmap
- Print list of collected/online hosts

I decided to use ansible ad-hoc commands to coplete this task.  
My pipeline had the following steps:

### Check connection to the host:  
```
Started by user admin
Running as SYSTEM
Building remotely on Ubuntu_old in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/sa1
[sa1] $ ansible redmine -i /tmp/inv.yaml -m ping -f 5
[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Distribution Ubuntu 16.04 on host redmine should use 
/usr/bin/python3, but is using /usr/bin/python for backward compatibility with 
prior Ansible releases. A future Ansible release will default to using the 
discovered platform python for this host. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/
2.8/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information. This 
feature will be removed in version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled 
by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
