## 03.GIT.Hosting
Here is the links to my test repositories:

[github](https://github.com/asilvanovich/test_silvanovich)

[bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/asilvanovich/silvanovich_test) 

[gitlab](https://gitlab.com/asilvanovich/silvanovich_test)

Bash script "push.sh" that pushes changes to the listed repositories is in the 03.GIT.Hosting folder.
