At my disposal there is a server with ubuntu to google cloud, so in this task the installation of an additional machine through the vagrant will not be done. The machine has a public ip address, which will allow you to access the server from the Internet in the future.
### Installing jenkins
#### Instal JAVA
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
```
#### Add the Jenkins Debian repository
```
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
```
#### Install Jenkins
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins
```
Jenkins uses port 8080 by default, but since on the server it is already used by another application, I changed the port to 8888 in the Jenkins settings and manage firewall:
```
sudo ufw allow 8888
```
And after all the above steps, you can go to the Jenkins home page at http://35.204.61.77:8888/ and make the default settings setup

### Hide Jenkins behind Nginx
Nginx was already installed earlier on this machine, in order to redirect to jenkins you need to change the nginx config file by adding the following lines to the location block
```
include /etc/nginx/proxy_params;
proxy_pass          http://127.0.0.1:8888;
```
After saving the changes and rebooting nginx jenkins will be available at http://35.204.61.77:80/
