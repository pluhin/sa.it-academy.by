## How to send Home work
1. Create fork from the main repository https://github.com/pluhin/sa.it-academy.by
2. Clone forked repository to your workstation
3. Checkout to branch <YOR_GROUP_BRANCH>
4. Create folder with your Name_LastName (As example: In my case name will be `Siarhei_Pishchyk`). This folder will be your report folder.
5. Create folder with name of your homework (Example: `02.Git.Local`)
6. Put your files into it.
7. Make commit and push
8. On WebUI (github) make PR (Pull Request) into main fork and branch <YOR_GROUP_BRANCH> from your fork and your <YOR_GROUP_BRANCH>
9. Wait for review
