# Devops, Laba 09 Jenkins Routine Results by Anton Kazlouski

The aim of it is to implement the following Jenkins pipeline. Valid jenkins is taken from the previous lab (08 Jenkins Start).

- Parameters: host IP and credentials
1. Check connection to the host
2. Install/upgrade nmap
3. Checks all online hosts
4. Remove nmap
5. Print list of collected/online hosts

Some useful commands

```bash

ssh-keygen -R "192.168.56.200"
vagrant ssh-config
vagrant halt && vagrant destroy -f
ansible-playbook --private-key=./vagrant/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key -i inventory/main.yaml  main.yaml
ansible-playbook --private-key=./vagrant/.vagrant/machines/jenkins/virtualbox/private_key -i inventory/main.yaml  main.yaml
ssh-add /home/anton/projects/ansible/08.Jenkins.Start/vagrant/.vagrant/machines/default/virtualbox/private_key
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network_connect true            // to enable redirect
sudo yum install epel-release
sudo yum install ansible
sudo -i -u jenkins
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add
#/var/lib/jenkins/.ssh/ запустил
#`ssh-keygen`
# ssh-add
ansible htp_host_01 -m apt-get -a "upgrade=yes update_cache=yes cache_valid_time=86400" --become -vvv
ps aux | grep -i nginx
scp user@192.168.254.228:/tmp/hosts_results.txt /tmp

```

## The results

### Check connection to the host

```bash

Running as SYSTEM

[10.Check_Connection] $ ansible htp_host_01 -m ping -f 5
[DEPRECATION WARNING]: Distribution Ubuntu 16.04 on host htp_host_01 should use
 /usr/bin/python3, but is using /usr/bin/python for backward compatibility with
 prior Ansible releases. A future Ansible release will default to using the 
discovered platform python for this host. See https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/
2.8/reference_appendices/interpreter_discovery.html for more information. This 
feature will be removed in version 2.12. Deprecation warnings can be disabled 
by setting deprecation_warnings=False in ansible.cfg.
