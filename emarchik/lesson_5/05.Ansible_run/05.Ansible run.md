# Lesson_5: Ansible Run

## Home task:
- Create playbook to print out remote host parameters:
 1. OS/version
 2. Mount point/capacity/used
 3. RAM/capacity/free
- Playbook for the ansible user:
 1. Create new user (use module)
 2. New user authorisation only by key
 3. Add to the sudo:nopasswd for upgrade command
 4. Implement test of that
 
> *All your playbook put into folder 05.Ansible run.*
> *Create file 05.Ansible run.md with description of your ansible roles (What it does, examples of command/parametrs) and add to your repository, then prepare PR (Pull Request)*

> In **anasible.log** ouput works  "ansible-playbook ansible_second_task.yml -vv"

## Disription:

This ansible playbook(tools) composed with 2 path.

### Task Path-1 - **Print remote host parameters:**
   - OS_FAMILY
   - OS_DISTRIBUTTION
   - DISTRIBUTTION_VERSION
   - NODE_NAME
   - NODE_ARCHITECTURE
   - POINT_MOUNTS
   - HDD_SIZE_TOTAL
   - HDD_AVAILABLE
   - RAM_TOTAL
   - RAM_FREE
   
   In this path code I define some vars which will print(see below):
```$yaml
- name: Asible Second Path_1 Task
  hosts: workstation
  tags:
    - second_task_path_1
  vars:
    parameters:
      - OS_FAMILY: "{{ ansible_os_family }}"
      - OS_DISTRIBUTTION: "{{ ansible_distribution }}"
      - DISTRIBUTTION_VERSION: "{{ ansible_distribution_version }}"
      - NODE_NAME: "{{ ansible_nodename }}"
      - NODE_ARCHITECTURE: "{{ ansible_architecture }}"
      - POINT_MOUNTS: "{{ ansible_mounts[0].mount }}"
      - HDD_SIZE_TOTAL: "{{ ansible_mounts[0].size_total }}"
      - HDD_AVAILABLE: "{{ ansible_mounts[0].size_available }}"
      - RAM_TOTAL: "{{ansible_memtotal_mb }}"
      - RAM_FREE: "{{ ansible_memfree_mb }}"
```
   Then I just printing:
```$yaml
tasks:
  - name: Print out remote host parameters
    debug:
      msg: "{{ parameters }}"
```

### Task Path-2 - **Worked with Users:**
  Composed with 2 Blocks:
       - REDHAT
       - DEBIAN 
  For each:
       - Create new user
       - Add authorized keys for User
       - Authorisation by key
       - Allow works without a password

In this path code(Blocks) composed with 3 'actions'(see below, example on 1 blocks):
    1. Creating ansible user
    2. Add authorized keys for ansible user on remote host
    3. Check 'sudores' and Allow user without a password.

```$yaml
- block: # ======== BLock for Redhat =========
      - name: "Creating User"
        user:
          name: agarim
          #group: "wheel"
          comment: "Add by Ansible user"
          state: present

      - name: "Add authorized keys for User"
        authorized_key:
           user: agarim
           state: present
           key: "{{ lookup('file', '/home/agarim/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"

      - name: "Allow  user  without a password"
        lineinfile:
          dest: "/etc/sudoers"
          state: "present"
          regexp: "^%agarim"
          line: "%agarim ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"
    when: ansible_os_family == "RedHat"
```
